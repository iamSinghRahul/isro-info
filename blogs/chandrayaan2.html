        <p>Chandrayaan-2 mission is a highly complex mission, which represents a significant technological leap compared
            to the previous missions of ISRO, which brought together an Orbiter, Lander and Rover with the goal of
            exploring south pole of the Moon. This is a unique mission which aims at studying not just one area of the
            Moon but all the areas combining the exosphere, the surface as well as the sub-surface of the moon in a
            single mission.</p>

        <img class="img" src="https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/article-files/hi/node/12970/rocket.jpg">
        <h2><strong>Why did we go to the Moon?</strong></h2>
        <p>Officially, the 24-minute Mars Orbital Insertion was the critical piece of the 300-day journey.
            Really,
            Mangalyaan was knocking on heaven’s door much before that, being a spacecraft with a mind of its
            own. Not
            even delineating the many things it can do – correcting altitude, controlling its temperature,
            repositioning
            its antenna for power and communication and in the future, jettison smart interplanetary missions –
            it has
            already solidified the validity of autonomy.</p>

        <h2><strong>What are the scientific objectives of Chandrayaan 2 ? Why was the Lunar South Pole targetted for
                exploration?</strong></h2>
        <p>Moon provides the best linkage to Earth’s early history. It offers an undisturbed historical record of the
            inner Solar system environment. Though there are a few mature models, further explanations were needed to
            understand the origin of the Moon. Extensive mapping of lunar surface to study variations in lunar surface
            were essential to trace back the origin and evolution of the Moon. Evidence for water molecules discovered
            by Chandrayaan-1, required further studies on the extent of water molecule distribution on the surface,
            below the surface and in the tenous lunar exosphere to address the origin of water on Moon.</p>

        <p>The Lunar South pole is especially interesting because of the lunar surface area that remains in shadow is
            much larger than that at the North Pole. There could be a possibility of presence of water in permanently
            shadowed areas around it. In addition, South Pole region has craters that are cold traps and contain a
            fossil record of the early Solar System.</p>
