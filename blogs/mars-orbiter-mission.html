        <p>We can conduct one of the largest and most complex relief and rescue operations and orbit the Mars within the span of a few weeks without cacophonic brouhaha. We can do so on  a budget that is as frugal as it is critical, we can do so to ascertain that the next time Kashmir gets flooded, Mangalyaan red flags it from Mars. We can enchant a global audience with 15 kgs and 15 months of scientific prowess. We can also charm snakes.</p>

        <p>Officially, the 24-minute Mars Orbital Insertion was the critical piece of the 300-day journey. Really, Mangalyaan was knocking on heaven’s door much before that, being a spacecraft with a mind of its own. Not even delineating the many things it can do – correcting altitude, controlling its temperature, repositioning its antenna for power and communication and in the future, jettison smart interplanetary missions – it has already solidified the validity of autonomy.</p>

        <p>At more than 82,000 kmph, carrying just 15kg of scientific instruments, Mangalyaan was able to map its path without once losing sight, or in this case, ISRO’s vision. The refined technological astuteness of ISRO’s vision has led to what we could envision only in science fiction – the technology of autonomy makes this odyssey, a conquest.</p>

        <p>The man behind the mission, project director Dr Subbiah Arunan’s labor of love took 15 months to fructify, but it may have taken a lot more of him and his family than we can list numerically, or simply.  Today, what we are celebrating comes at a sacrifice that most would demur from making, even if it is for the country…ask Arunan’s wife, Geetha who is happy he will finally get to spend time with the family. The same could very easily be ascribed to everyone who worked on the project, and indeed everyone that is serving the nation, or a ‘higher purpose’ gladly suspending their personal lives in the hope of creating something that feeds more than our stomachs – national aspiration crowned by national pride. Our soldiers undertake a gargantuan ‘MOM’ every single day, sometimes not just sidelining their personal lives, but also by willingly putting themselves at peril for a larger good. The recent Kashmir floods saw unparalleled agility, valor and sacrifice of the Armed Forces to defend the people of a state that often turns to devour its own in the frenzied extremism funneled by separatists. Our soldiers delivered in the context of a sleeping Gilani and a weeping Kashmir. Point is, for the Mars Orbiter to go where it needed to, a town in Valliyur and a dog named Chocolate had to stay where they do. The supposed ordinary, the status quo, is what made this mission great – made an odyssey, a conquest.</p>
            
        <p>For a country that is still sometimes  mired in effete dogma and snuffs progressive thought as anarchic –we saw quite a few contrarieties boldly defying what should have been conclusively shelved anyway: we are ready to orbit the Mars, while we obsess over the placement of that very planet in our horoscope charts; we launched the orbiter at a day that is considered inauspicious, but that sits on the cusp of the most auspicious festive season in India; the orbiter was in the sky on a day generally considered ‘eclipsed’ (Amavasya) to basically shatter skepticism relative to India’s virgin odyssey where others have ricocheted, and only then, succeeded. So while we justifiably celebrated this momentous achievement, we also moved beyond our innate superstitious propensity. Today – to Mars – tomorrow, wherever science, faith and diligence take us. The conjunction of habitual faith (sometimes lack and defiance of it), and adventurous scientific endeavor make this odyssey, a conquest.</p>
            
        <p>Naysayers and moderators are trying to underplay (in vain) this laudable achievement by placing the lens on some of the issues that India is grappling with – poverty, environmental transgressions – (neither of which are our solitary shame!) by saying that we should focus on resolving these issues first. From that very vortex, despite those very issues, and eventually to make strides that will have an impact on our global standing on those very issues – we went on to leapfrog the MOM – doesn’t that make this odyssey, a conquest?<p>
        <p>Or is it just easier to charm snakes?</p>
